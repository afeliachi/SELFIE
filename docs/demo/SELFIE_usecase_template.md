# SELFIE Demonstration Write Up Template

## Use Case Description

<!--
this is talking about a “domain” use case (SELFIE is the technical use-case — 🤪)
-->

A few sentence narrative of the use case (non technical)

[**Add a prominent link to the demo if possible**](https://opengeospatial.github.io/ELFIE/demo/template)

### User Story

<!--
Who is this person we call user? Help make them real.
-->

A one sentence story.

### Datasets and Sources

<!---
Use this section to document your data and the distributed network of data providers.
Alude to the non information resource and information content that satisfies the use
case. Discussion of how the unique use case uses the SELFIE "core" concepts should be
included here.

- A bulleted
- list of datasets
- and data providers
- in the use case.

## Demo Description and Links

A few sentence description of how the demo works and/or was created -- relate to SELFIE goals.

<!--
Also add one or more screenshots or other graphics with a descriptive caption for each.  
Add screenshots to https://github.com/opengeospatial/ELFIE/tree/master/docs/images 
so they show up at a path like: `https://opengeospatial.github.io/ELFIE/images/ELFIE_logo.png`  
-->

### Links to Demo Resources

Add links to source files, code used, example JSON-LD files, etc. Add descriptive text so 
people can walk through the demo themselves without much prior knowledge. Describe how 
the links in the data can be traversed, especially how the links are/were traversed by the demo
application.

## Demo findings and potential next steps

Discuss issues that this demo works around or would otherwise need to be solved to take
it from demonstration/experiment to production. Talk about how the SELFIE core of 303
redirection and use of JSON-LD in HTML landing pages works in the context of the complete
technical setting of your use case. Discussion of what future experimentation is needed
should go here.
