=== Relationship to OGC-API

OGC API-Features was evaluated for providing both URL-14 landing-content and URL-200 data-content and found to be largely compatible with both. For provision of landing content, a feature would be provided as JSON-LD and html with JSON-LD structured data in a `<script>` element containing the URI-14 as its primary subject. In this case, hypermedia containing links to items in a feature-collection would contain links to URI-14s rather than display any URL-14s. Since OGC API-Features supports feature-level access by item id (`/collections/{collectionid}/items/{itemid}`) or a feature attribute (`/collections/{collectionid}/items?uri=https://id.com/id`) it can be used as a flexible building block in linked data architectures.
